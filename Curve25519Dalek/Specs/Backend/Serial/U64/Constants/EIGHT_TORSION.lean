/-! # Spec Theorem for `constants::EIGHT_TORSION`

Specification and proof for the constant `EIGHT_TORSION`.

This constant represents the 8-torsion subgroup E[8] of the Edwards curve,
which consists of all points P such that 8P = 0. In the case of Curve25519,
this subgroup is cyclic and is generated by a point of order 8.

The array is organized such that the i-th element is [i]P, where P is a
generator of order 8. This means:
- E[4] (the 4-torsion subgroup) consists of indices 0,2,4,6
- E[2] (the 2-torsion subgroup) consists of indices 0,4

natural language description:

    • EIGHT_TORSION is a constant array of 8 Edwards points representing the
      8-torsion subgroup E[8] of the Edwards curve, i.e., all points P where 8P = 0.
    • The subgroup is cyclic, generated by a point P of order 8.
    • The i-th element of the array is [i]P (i times P in the group law).
    • The element at index 0 is the identity point (0P = 0).
    • The elements at indices 0,2,4,6 form the 4-torsion subgroup E[4].
    • The elements at indices 0,4 form the 2-torsion subgroup E[2].

natural language specs:

    • All 8 elements of EIGHT_TORSION are valid Edwards points.
    • The element at index 0 is the identity point.
    • For each point P in EIGHT_TORSION, we have 8P = 0.
    • The element at index 1 has order exactly 8 (generates the entire subgroup).
    • For all i ∈ {0,...,7}, EIGHT_TORSION[i] = [i] · EIGHT_TORSION[1].

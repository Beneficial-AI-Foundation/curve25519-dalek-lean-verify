/-! # Externally Verified attribute

`@[externally_verified]` marks a theorem whose proof uses `sorry` but has been
verified externally (e.g., a proof exists but not in Lean).

This allows distinguishing intentional `sorry` from genuinely incomplete proofs, both
for human readers and for automated tools that harvest verification status. -/

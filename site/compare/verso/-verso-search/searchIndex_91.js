Should typically be at least as\nshort as shortTitle.The book's authorsAn extra note to show after the author listThe publication dateThe main tag for the part, used for cross-references.If this part ends up as the root of a file, use this name for itThe internal unique ID, which is automatically assigned during traversal.Should this section be numbered? If false, then it's like \\section* in LaTeXIf true, the part is only rendered in draft mode.Which number has been assigned? This field is set during traversal.If true, this part will display a list of subparts that are separate HTML pages.How should this document be split when rendering multi-page HTML output?\n\nWhen rendering multi-page HTML, should splitting pages follow the depth setting?Follow the main settingDo not split here nor in child parts\n\nThe Manual genre's block and inline element types are extensible.\nIn the document, they consist of instances of Manual.Block and Manual.Inline, respectively:\n\nA custom block. The name field should correspond to an entry in the block descriptions table.A unique name that identifies the block.A unique ID, assigned during traversal.Data saved by elaboration, potentially updated during traversal, and used to render output. This\nis the primary means of communicating information about a block between phases.A registry for properties that can be used to create ad-hoc protocols for coordination between\nblock elements in extensions.\n\nA custom inline.

This\nis the primary means of communicating information about a block between phases.\n\nThe fields Block.name and Inline.name are used to look up concrete implementations of traversal and output generation in run-time tables that contain descriptions:\n\nImplementations of all the operations needed to use a block.All registered initializers are called in the state prior to the first traversal.How the traversal phase should process this blockHow to generate HTML.

If so, how should it be represented?Entries should be returned as a preference-ordered array of representations. Each representation\nconsists of a string and some HTML; the string should represent the HTML's content if all\nformatting were stripped. Items are compared for string equality, with later suggestions used in\ncase of overlap, but the HTML is what's displayed. Exceptions are logged as errors during HTML\ngeneration.The empty array means that the block should not be included.How to generate TeX.

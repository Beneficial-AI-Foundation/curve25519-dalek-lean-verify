The author writes the document's text in Verso's markup language, which is parsed to Lean's own Syntax type2. The document is elaborated to a representation as a Lean data structure3. The resulting Lean code is compiled to an executable4. When run, the executable resolves cross-references and computes other globally-scoped metadata in a step referred to as the traversal pass5.

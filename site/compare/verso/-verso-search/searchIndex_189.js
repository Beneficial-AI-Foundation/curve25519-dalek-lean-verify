Instances of TraversePart and\nTraverseBlock for a genre specify how this is updated while traversing parts and blocks,\nrespectively.The mutable state used in the genre's traversal pass.\n\nEach document consists of a Part.\nThe part's title is the title of the entire document.\n\nA logical division of a document.\n\nParts contain Blocks:\n\nBlock-level content in a document.\n\nBlocks contain Inlines:\n\nInline content that is part of the text flow.\n\nThe metadata field of Part typically gets its value from a metadata block written by the author, though it may be assigned more information during traversal.\nThe Block.other and Inline.other constructors typically result from elaborating extension points.\n\n","context":"Writing Documentation in Lean with Verso\u0009Building Documents","header":"3.1.

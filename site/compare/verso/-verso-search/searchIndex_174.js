This can be done for HTML elements, attribute values, or whole sets of attributes.* Text content is written as Lean string literals to facilitate precise control over whitespace.* Interpolated Lean strings (with s!) may be used in any context that expects a string.\n\nFor example, this definition creates a <ul> list:\n\nopen Verso.Output.Html\n\ndef mkList (xs : List Html) : Html :=\n  {{ <ul> {{ xs.map ({{<li>{{·}}</li>}}) }} </ul>}}\n\n#eval mkList [\"A\", {{<emph>\"B\"</emph>}}, \"C\"]\n  |>.asString\n  |> IO.println\n\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    A</li>\n  <li>\n    <emph>B</emph></li>\n  <li>\n    C</li>\n  </ul>\n\n\n","context":"Writing Documentation in Lean with Verso\u0009Output Formats","header":"5.1.

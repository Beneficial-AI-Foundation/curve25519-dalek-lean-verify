## Curve25519-dalek

[Curve25519-dalek](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek) is a pure-Rust implementation of group operations on Curve25519. 
It provides fast, safe cryptographic primitives used by thousands of projects for key agreement, signatures and zero-knowledge proofs.

## Project aims

This project aims to **prove the functional correctness** of the curve25519-dalek implementation. 
Using [Aeneas](https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas), we obtain a faithful representation of the Rust code in [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org), a powerful proof assistant. This allows us to harness Lean's mathematical capabilities to write precise specifications and formally prove that the implementation satisfies them.

The aims are two fold:

- Formally verify the chosen subset of functions from this crate
- Figure out how formal verification can be done on large scale, quicker, cheaper and commonplace


## Our Progress

Check out the [home page](/) to see which functions have been verified and track our progress through the codebase.

## The Scalability Challenge

Formal verification has traditionally been resource-intensive and time-consuming. 
**Can we find ways to solve the scalability problem of formal verification?** 

If you're interested in the verification methodology or formal methods at scale, we'd love your insights and contributions.

## Trust Model

See below for information on what we need to trust to rely on these proofs.

## Source Information

This repository contains the curve25519-dalek Rust crate from:
- **Repository**: https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek
- **Commit**: `8016d6d9b9cdbaa681f24147e0b9377cc8cef934`
- **Tag**: `curve25519-4.2.0`
- **Version**: 4.2.0

Here we work exclusively with the 64 bit serial backend. I.e., we compile the Rust code with the flags:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS='--cfg curve25519_dalek_backend="serial" --cfg curve25519_dalek_bits="64"' cargo build
```

From this we have chosen a subset of functions which isn't all of those in this crate with this particular choice of backend but it is a useful complete set for typical cryptographic applications.

## Status tracking

- The file `status.csv` is the source of truth for tracking progress of the project, updates to this file should be made when functions are extracted, have specs added or if verification is complete
- The column `extracted` can be empty of have the value `extracted`
- The column `verified`  can be empty or have the values `draft spec`, `specified` or `verified`
    - ‚úèÔ∏è **draft spec** - Draft spec (in natural language) has been added
    - üìã **specified** - Formal specification in Lean added
    - ‚úÖ **verified** - Function has been formally verified (spec theorem has been proven)


## CI

- CI will automatically update the project site when the file `status.csv` is updated
- Whilst fixes to Aeneas are in progress we sometimes make modifications to the Rust source code in order to enable extraction, the changes are recorded in `src-modifications.diff` and CI checks that this file is updated
- The CI runs Aeneas on the source code and checks that the generated files, `Types.lean` and `Funs.lean` haven't been modified since extraction (not active, to be activated soon)
- CI checks that the Lean project builds without errors. It permits the presence of `sorry` since this often represents work in progress

## Trust and Verification Method

### Verification Approach

[Lean] is an open-source programming language and proof assistant, allowing us to write mathematical specifications and prove that the implementation meets these specifications.

In this approach to formal verification, the Rust code is extracted (translated) to a representation in Lean.
The idea is that the Lean code is then a faithful functional representation of the Rust code. 
This is done in a way that panics, failure to terminate, etc., are represented in the extracted code, in addition to being an accurate function representation. 
In this project we use [Aeneas] for this extraction.

### What You Need to Trust

To trust that the curve25519-dalek implementation satisfies the proven specifications, you need to trust:

#### 1. The Lean Proof Checker
- Lean‚Äôs minimal trusted kernel guarantees absolute correctness in the proofs

#### 2. The Aeneas Translation
- One needs to know that the Lean code extracted by Aeneas faithfully represents the Rust code, this is a limited set of translations and subject to ongoing [soundness proofs][aeneas-proofs] 

#### 3. The Specifications
- The specifications are written in Lean which allows a phrasing which is convenient for humans to parse and allows easy drilling down into details using the interactive feature of Lean

#### 4. External specifications
- External dependencies of the crate have specs written in `FunsExternal.lean` and `TypesExternal.lean` so these files need to be inspected to ensure that these specs are correct

### What You Don't Need to Check
- Trust of spec proofs doesn't require inspecting the proofs themselves since this is checked by Lean
- That no additional axioms have been introduced in the proofs can be checked by `#print axioms spec_theorem_name`

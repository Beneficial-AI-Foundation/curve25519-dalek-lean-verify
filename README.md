# Project to formally verify Dalek elliptic curve cryptography

**[ðŸ“– View Project Site](https://beneficial-ai-foundation.github.io/curve25519-dalek-lean-verify/)**

A project to formally verify the Rust implementation of [curve25519-dalek](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek) using [Lean](https://lean-lang.org) and [Aeneas](https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas).

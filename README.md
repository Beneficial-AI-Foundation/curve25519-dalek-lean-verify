# Project to formally verify, using Lean, Dalek elliptic curve cryptography

A project to formally verify [curve25519-dalek](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek), a Rust implementation of elliptic curve cryptography.
The formal verification uses [Lean](https://lean-lang.org) and relies on the Lean representation of the Rust code produced by [Aeneas](https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas).

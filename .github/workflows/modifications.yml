name: Modifications Diff

# This workflow ensures that src-modifications.diff is kept in sync with the actual
# modifications made to the curve25519-dalek source code.
# The diff is generated by comparing the upstream source (at the specific commit)
# with the modified source in this repository.
#
# This check will fail if someone modifies the source code but forgets to regenerate
# src-modifications.diff, ensuring the documentation of changes is always up to date.

# TODO

- Check if there are other modules to extract or if the entire crate can be extracted without using `--start-from`.
- Check if any of the `--exclude` can be permitted now
- Check if there is anything which needs to be added to `FunsExternal.lean` or `TypesExternal.lean`
- Make sure that `Funs.lean`, etc. all build.
- Remove the stray Hoare files from the previous attempt.
- Continue the process of updating every spec theorem.
